# YoshiCrafter Engine's Extra Documentation

A extra guide in case Yoshi's documentation was a bit too much for you. (or if you just don't understand it)

Check the [Wiki Page](https://github.com/WizardMantis441/yce-tutorials/wiki) for all the information you need.

side note: didn't make any code examples yet, will do that after i finish documenting everything in the toolbox
